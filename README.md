Sir, You Are A Cartographer
=====

A mapping/cartography script for the computer game [Sir, You Are Being
Hunted](http://www.big-robot.com/tag/sir-you-are-being-hunted/), a
"procedurally-generated first-person game of stealth and survival set in
a very british world where robots hunt humans for sport".

This script aims to produce a similar level of nice-looking, as is found
within the game itself. Usage for cheating is entirely optional.

This script is based largely off the [Sir, You Are Being Mapped](http://www.big-robot.com/forum/showthread.php?1186-Sir-You-Are-Being-Modded&p=8048&viewfull=1#post8048)
mod, itself the work of [Kay Johnston](http://www.big-robot.com/forum/member.php?828-Kay-Johnston).
All credit to them for deciphering the game XML and scripting the
output of a useful island map to admire or cheat with.

The map background was obtained from [Subtle
Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/old-map/).
