* Installation of Pillow requires python-dev to be installed.
* Pillow requires some additional image libraries to be configured: see
  [http://codeinthehole.com/writing/how-to-install-pil-on-64-bit-ubuntu-1204/]
* Install to a virtualenv (assuming virtualenvwrapper is present and
  configured): `mkvirtualenv -r requirements.txt sir_cartographer`
